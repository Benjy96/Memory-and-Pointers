# Memory-and-Pointers

I enjoy learning about the underlying structure of computers, and memory & pointers seems a good place to look.

Often, computers are viewed beneath a veil of mysticism, due in no small part to the many layers of abstraction
that obfuscate even experienced programmers from the underlying principles.

The code in this project is either taken or inspired from Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and 
Practice Using C++", Chapter 17.
